# Django Tweeter

Django Tweeter is a dynamic web application that allows users to manage tweets with full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Built using the Django framework, it emphasizes user authentication and authorization to ensure a secure and personalized experience.

## About the Project

This project is designed to mimic a basic version of a tweet management system. Users can register, log in, and interact with tweets in a secure environment. Key features include:

- **Registration**: Users can create accounts to join the platform.
- **Login/Logout**: Secure authentication for accessing the application.
- **Tweet Management**:
  - Create tweets with an optional media upload.
  - Edit existing tweets while ensuring only the original author can make changes.
  - Delete tweets after confirmation, restricted to the owner.

The application dynamically lists all tweets on the homepage, sorted by their creation time (newest first).

## Features

2. **Authorization**:
